# Customer-Churn-Analysis-BI-Storyboard-Python-Power-BI (In-Progress).
Telecom companies lose significant revenue due to customer churn. Without identifying churn drivers, retention strategies fail. The business project I am solving is analyzing telecom customer churn using **Python-based EDA and machine learning** and converts insights into an interactive Power BI insight storyboard for business decision-making.


  


 Customer Churn Analysis & BI Storyboard (Python + Power BI)

Project Overview
This project analyzes telecom customer churn using  Python-based EDA and machine learning and converts insights into an interactive Power BI insight storyboard for business decision-making.



Business Problem
Telecom companies lose significant revenue due to customer churn. Without identifying churn drivers, retention strategies fail.

This project:
  Identifies churn patterns  
  Predicts high-risk customers  
  Translates findings into actionable insights  



Tech Stack & Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- Power BI (visual storytelling)
- Jupyter Notebook
- CSV dataset (Telco Customer Churn)



 Project Structure







 Model I will be using
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest (optional)
- Evaluation metrics:
